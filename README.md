# 676-deepfake-detection

The final results all came from the file `combined_classifer.ipynb`. In order to run it it should be uploaded to Google Colab, and you will need to add https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xT-Rg8qKLaw7B-pIG0INoFoiE8CdSSvS?usp=sharing to your own drive to use it. You will need to add a link from shared files to your main drive. The folder includes previously trained models, the dataset we used, the preprocessed videos for both classifiers, and a few different premade models we had attempted to use.
